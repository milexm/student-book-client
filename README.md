## Overview

The first time the user starts the application she is presented with the following menu of possible choices:

For example, if the user enter **ga** (get all), the client app issues a REST GET call to the service which returns the stored information for all students, such as:

	{
	  "id" : 10001,
	  "name" : "George Washington",
	  "email" : "georgew@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "253 222 3456"
	}, {
	  "id" : 10002,
	  "name" : "Lucas Davenport",
	  "email" : "lucasd@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "425 123 4567"
	}, {
	  "id" : 10003,
	  "name" : "Mary Smith",
	  "email" : "marys@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "360 234 5678"
	}, {	"id":10007,
		"name":"mike smith",
		"email":"mikes@gmail.com",
		"phoneNumber":"253 333 4444"
	}

### Prerequisites
To build the client app you need the following:

- [Maven 3.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) as your build tool.
- Your favorite IDE. We use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).
- [JDK 1.8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

### Client Architectural Elements

- **Main**.  Initializes the application and the UI classes. Displays the selection menu. Starts the menu loop to allow the user to make the selection.
- **SimpleUI**. Displays a selection menu for the user. Processes the  user's input and calls the proper method based on the user's selection. Each method calls the related student-book-service REST API.
-  **RestOperations**. Performs REST operations using the the service **StudentResource** class. Each method calls the related student-book-service REST API. 
In particular it uses the **Spring Boot** framework. For more information, see [Spring Boot Restful Client with RestTemplate example](https://o7planning.org/en/11647/spring-boot-restful-client-with-resttemplate-example#a13887020)
- **RestOperation**. Performs REST operations using the service StudentResource class. Each method calls the related student-book-service REST API. In particular it uses the Apache Http client. For more information, see [Simple REST Client in Java](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/09/simple-rest-client-in-java.html) 
- **Utility**. Defines utility methods and variables to support the application operations such as menu creation, list initialization and so on.

## Using the App
